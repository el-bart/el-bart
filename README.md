# hello, stranger

i'm BaSz and i'm a nerd.
some of my favourites are: Linux, C++, ÂµC, embedded systems, DevOps, 3D printing, distributed systems, networks.
more on me on my website: [baszerr.eu](https://baszerr.eu).

on CyberSec side of force, note that:
* each commit from me is signed (GH verified - since ~2017)
* each e-mail from my will be PGP-signed with [my key](https://baszerr.eu/misc/pgp.txt)

if that's not the case, assume it did not originate from me.
