# hello, stranger

i'm BaSz and i'm a nerd.
some of my favourites are: Linux, C++, ÂµC, embedded systems, DevOps, 3D printing, distributed systems, networks.
more on me on [my website](https://baszerr.eu).

on CyberSec side of force, note that:
* my every commit is signed (GH verified - since ~2017)
* my every e-mail will be PGP-signed with [my key](https://baszerr.eu/misc/pgp.txt)

if that's not the case, assume change/message did not originate from real me.
